## Therapist-AI

# Inspiration
Our inspiration behind AI Therapy was the millions of Canadians who suffer from mental health issues but are too afraid to talk about them. So that was when we thought about how we could use artificial intelligence to develop a therapist that you can trust

# What it does
AI Therapy is a website that lends an ear to users, standing with them and helping them with their mental health issues. Users start off by speaking to the AI directly using the "Ask a Question" button. Users can use this button to freely pour out their concerns of life because sometimes having somebody to listen can be therapeutic. After the user finishes speaking the AI then replies back to the user with a comforting voice using the text to speech. (Note: If you are testing the product from GitHub repo you must add your own ChatGPT api key in the apikey.js).

# How we built it
The project was built using the Open AI API and JavaScript. We also used HTML/CSS to design the website.

# Challenges we ran into
Creating AI Therapy made us run into many problems such as:

Setting up the Open AI API. This caused us many problems since it was difficult to find a resource on this topic that catered towards our needs. Eventually we came to a point where we had to search the Open AI API Documentation for answers. This step was also even more difficult since it was our first time setting up the Open AI API so whenever we ran into problems they would take a lot of time to solve.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud of setting up the ChatGPT AI API. Solving the, what seemed to be, millions of problems that occurred. We're also proud of setting up the text to speech program and speech to text program. And of course we're proud for making this project within the small time frame given.

# What we learned
When making AI Therapy we learned how to set up the Open AI API and as well as the text to speech and speech to text programs. And of course we learned how to make it work with a website. Working on AI Therapy has also sharpened our problem solving skills.

# What's next for AI Therapy
Since project was made within a small time frame there were many things that we still wanted to include such as:

# Adding different voices for the AI (Making them more human-like using AI)
Making the AI remember more of the conversation (currently it only remembers the last thing said by the user and the AI)
